# Research

## Bayesian Nonparametrics

**Title**: [Adaptive Density Estimation via Infinite Mixture Models](#)  
**Authors**: Cheng Zeng, Hani Doss, Baba Vemuri  
We propose a Dirichlet Process Mixture framework for adaptive density estimation with applications in clustering and uncertainty quantification.

## Bayesian Semiparametrics

**Title**: [Generalized Bayes via Convex Loss and Variational Approximation](#)  
**Authors**: Cheng Zeng, Hani Doss  
We develop a robust semiparametric model using a convex-likelihood approach combined with variational Bayes for efficient inference.

## Conditional Density Estimation with Normalizing Flows

**Title**: [Augmented Posterior for Flow-based Models in Supervised Tasks](#)  
**Authors**: Cheng Zeng, Baba Vemuri  
We introduce a new objective for normalizing flows to improve conditional density estimation with applications to image generation and representation learning.
